## Intro

DS Viper is a powerful tool designed to bypass Windows Defender's security mechanisms, enabling seamless execution of payloads on Windows systems without triggering security alerts. It uses a combination of advanced techniques to manipulate and disguise its payloads, providing attackers with a robust method for achieving undetected access.

Developed for penetration testers, red teamers, and cybersecurity professionals, DS Viper leverages sophisticated evasion methods to circumvent the most common Windows Defender defenses. Whether you're simulating a real-world attack or conducting a security audit, DS Viper serves as an essential tool for testing and improving system defenses.
